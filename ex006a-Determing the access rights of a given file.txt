Access rights of a file in linux is determined by a 10 bit string which might look like -rw-r--r--.

The first bit represents whether it is a file or a directory
- represents a file
d represents a directory

___ ___ ___
rwx rwx rwx
    OR
www www www

rwx = 7 and so

777 means full rights

0 means reset (-)
1 means set   (r/w/x depending on the bit's position)

for eg., in the example file where the access rights was -rw-r--r--,

first of all this is a file and not a directory (gotten from the first bit)

now taking the remaining bit rw-r--r--, lets fill all character positions with 1 and all -'s with 0, 

thus giving us 110100100 which roughly translates to 644.

The above rights state that 

1. The file owner(110) has read and write permissions while no execute permission
2. The group owner of the file (100) has only read permissions
3. All other users (100) have only read permissions.
